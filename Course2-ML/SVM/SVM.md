# Introduction

Welcome to the module on 'Support Vector Machines', or SVMs.

 

You have studied some well-known classification models, i.e. logistic regression and naive Bayes. Though these models are widely used in industries such as banking, e-commerce etc. and applications such as default prediction and text classification, they find limited use in more complex classification problems, such as image classification.

 SVMs, as you will see, are capable of dealing with quite complex problems, where models such as logistic regression typically fail. SVMs have been extensively used for solving complex classification problems such as image recognition, voice detection etc.

SVMs are mostly used for classification tasks, but they can also be used for regression. The topics covered in this module are limited to classification tasks. In this module, you will apply SVMs to email spam detection and alphabetic letter recognition problems.
