Line Graph and Histogram
In this segment, you will learn about two new visualisation charts, which are as follows:

Line graph

Histogram


Line graph:
A line graph is used to present continuous time-dependent data. 
It accurately depicts the trend of a variable over a specified time period. 
Let’s watch the next video to learn how to plot a line chart using the Matplotlib library.

You can use the following command to plot a line graph:

plt.plot(x_axis, y_axis)

Remember to be careful while using the plt.plot function. 
This function also helps you create a scatter plot when you tweak the syntax and specify the markers. 
Try to run the following code to understand the difference between the outputs of the function:

y = np.random.randint(1,100, 50)
plt.plot(y, 'ro') # ‘ro’ represents color (r) and marker (o)

If you specify the colour and marker separately, then you will get a line plot with the points marked. 
Try to run the following the code for this:

plt.plot(y, 'red', marker = 'o')

A line graph can be helpful when you want to identify the trend of a particular variable. Some key industries and services that rely on line graphs include financial markets and weather forecast.

In the video above, you learnt how to rotate the tick labels on the axes using the following command:

plt.yticks(rotation = number)  #could do for xticks as well


In the video above, you learnt how to use the annotate method to add data labels to the plot. The code given below was used in the previous video.

 

# plt.plot(months, sales)

# Adding and formatting title
plt.title("Sales across 2015\n", fontdict={'fontsize': 20, 'fontweight' : 5, 'color' : 'Green'})

# Labeling Axes
plt.xlabel("Months", fontdict={'fontsize': 12, 'fontweight' : 5, 'color' : 'Brown'})
plt.ylabel("Sales", fontdict={'fontsize': 12, 'fontweight' : 5, 'color' : 'Brown'} )

ticks = np.arange(0, 600000, 50000)
labels = ["{}K".format(i//1000) for i in ticks]
plt.yticks(ticks, labels)

plt.xticks(rotation=90)

for xy in zip(months, sales):
    plt.annotate(s = "{}K".format(xy[1]//1000), xy = xy,  textcoords='data')

plt.show()

In the earlier segment on scatter plot, you used the annotate method to add data labels to a scatter plot. 
Similarly, the annotate method can be used to add data labels to graphs as well.
Now that you know the basics of line graphs, attempt the following questions.
