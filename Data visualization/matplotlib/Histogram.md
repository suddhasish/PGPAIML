Histograms
A histogram is a frequency chart that records the number of occurrences of an entry or an element in a data set. 
It can be useful when you want to understand the distribution of a given series. 
Letâ€™s watch the next video to learn how to plot a histogram.

As shown in the video above, you can use the following command to plot a histogram:
plt.hist(profit, bins = 100,edgecolor='Orange',color='cyan')

plt.show()

The x-ticks in the histogram above are not very informative. 
Let's try to add more detailed x-ticks so that the data is more readable. In the next video, you will learn how to add more information to classes and x-ticks.
